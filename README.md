----- Contents of this Assignment ----- 
    
    1. Alphabet Soup Problem - A program that sorts the letters of a word alphabetically
    2. Emoticon Problem - A simple program that replaces certain words with emoticons/emojis
    3. Unpacking List Problem - A program that shows the first element, the middle elements, and 
        the last element of the list    
---------------- Notes ----------------
    
    - I debugged my code multiple times and used module notes, YouTube tutorials, and 
      other online references to understand  concepts I was not confident with.
    - This repository is part of my journey in learning basic Python programming

###Analysis of Unpacking List Problem
- The first element of the list is stored in `first`.
- The last element of the list is stored in `last`.
- All elements between the first and last are stored in `middle` using the `*` operator.
- This shows that Python's unpacking feature allows us to separate a list into specific parts easily, which can be useful for processing sequences of data.
  
-------------- How to run ------------- 
    
    1. Clone or download the repository
    2. Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook
    3. Run all cells in order to test the programs.
